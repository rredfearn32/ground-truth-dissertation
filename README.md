# Ground Truth App
## An undergraduate dissertation project

This is my dissertation project from my undergraduate university course, graduated in 2013.

The application is intended to allow users to specify objects in images via regions of interest (ROIs), which could then be used for image recognition, etc.

It's intended to allow users to:

- Create an account
- Upload and manage images
- Utlize HTMl5 canvas to allow ROI creation

### Note
The code quality is pretty shite; I really didn't know what I was doing at the time. But I wanted to upload it in its exact form. That way, I can look back and see my own improvement.
